## Purpose

Write up ideas from discussion with Kerstin and Jakob.

### Summary

### Paper I want to write

### Data that I will need for this

For the questions about individual responses to a shock, for instance the introduction of a railway line, we need to have annonymised data linked over time.

### Next steps

There is a lot of scholarship looking at movement of people and the effect that this has had on demographic outcomes. For example [Karlskrona paper on neighbour being tertiary educated](), 

What do we want to focus on? 

- Local place based things. 
- 

### Write up of Jakob's ideas

The mantalslängder begin to include a place of work on the forms relatively early. Perhaps in the 1920s.

Taking pictures of these books - think carefully becaue the size is large - sometimes it goes over two full pages... really big.

Have a look at Martin Önnefors thesis - check his sources. He has a digitized version of mantalslängder from soemthing like Rotmans arkivet. Highly frequent. Digitized.

I should focus on firms so that I don't overlap with other researchers in the area.

Instead of using aktibolag dataset, I should have a look at the industrial firms. These have things like horsepower used as some quantification of amount of power used and the number of workers.

Have a look for Jakob's paper on uppsala's economic geography with Martin. His thesis was on Restaurants in Stockholm. Have a look at this too.

They make use of address calendars - has every firms location. Can do the same for Stockholm. 

Interesting thing to look at would the transportation technology change. How do:
- Trams then
- Cars and trains (Jakob mentioned a list of all car owners in Uppsala)
- Subway

We can think about where the line goes - how do people who live along the tram or subway line respond to it - do they begin to work further away??

Resources for census data: Born digital from Riksarkivet. Much less expensive than SCB. Jakob thinks it will be around 6 000 SEK. This covers all of Sweden, 60, 65, 70, 75. Has place of birth alongside current location.

We won't need a "tikprovning"? Maybe an ethics clearance.

Counterfactual for shock would be some city plan that were not built, e.g. subway line that was not completed. The Ghost Station on the blue line.

Gamla Stan - another coutner factual - it would have been destroyed by le corbusier.

What are the questions we might like to ask?

In a similar vein as the Iceland paper - What happened to the people who were displaced - did this differ by age? 

How did it change segregation? One policy was to move people to newly integrated neigbourhoods. We can measure this before and after.

How did occupational movement change - if you are suddenly offered the chance to move - then what does it mean for your choice of occupation? Do you move to another job. Where do you work? Where do you live?

The control group are close to various amenities - they don't leave the city. But the treatment group do - their children may now grow up in the suburbs. How do we follow people and their children??

It's kind of a similar paper to the Iceland paper. If you get treated - then you move to a different lcoality. First questions we have to answer is where you moved - was it to a suburb - was it further away.

How does the clustering of people change - do you move to where your neighbours end up after treatment??

Do you move your entire neighbourhood??

### POA

Read about the Chetty paper. Read about the removal that happenned in Stockholm to better understand the shock - when in time - what happenned?? How much data would we need to make it happen? Is this restricted?
